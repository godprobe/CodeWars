# Codewars
Running through random kata (code exercises) on the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) website.

I'll most likely be sticking with Go for the majority.

Each kata has its own `go.mod` file, in large part due to not initially comprehending Go project structures and the differences between packages and modules. With a `go.work` file to wrangle all the kata together, this still shakes out okay, but this repo is definitely not one that should normally be imported into other projects.

Some of my few older solves using C++, JavaScript, and Python are in my [CodeWars 2019](https://github.com/godprobe/CodeWars_2019) repo. Or you can visit [my Codewars profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/godprobe) directly.
